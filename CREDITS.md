# Adapted Code

Contains some very adapted code from [libnoise](https://github.com/cookiephone/libnoise-rs) and [fastnoise_lite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite).
Mostly this is precomputed constants, look up tables, and reframed formulas.

Lots of neat optimization tricks were inspired by libnoise implementations and built on.
